[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/Zomzog/zomzog.fr-theme/badge.svg?targetFile=package.json)](https://snyk.io/test/github/Zomzog/zomzog.fr-theme?targetFile=package.json)


## Building (For Developers)
This theme uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. A static version of this is already included, but if you want to bump the version, tweak the style, etc, you'll need to rebuild the assets. Make sure you have NodeJS >= v6 installed, and then run the following from inside the theme's directory:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
